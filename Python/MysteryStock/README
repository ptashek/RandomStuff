Given an array of stock prices, each representing a different timestamp
and ordered by time in ascending order, find the biggest profit
(or smallest loss) one could make, provided that stock must be bought
before it can be sold, and no buy/sell operation may occurr within the same
time slot.

Example:

 [35, 41, 17, 8, 5, 26, 29, 47, 20, 44, 38, 11, 14, 23, 32]
 Buy at 5 to sell at 47, for total profit of 42

 [11, 47, 8, 20, 5, 35, 17, 23, 26, 29, 41, 32, 38, 14, 44]
 Buy at 5 to sell at 44, for total profit of 39
