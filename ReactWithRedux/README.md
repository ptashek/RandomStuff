This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Things demonstrated here:

+ React, with Redux ([React Coomunity](https://github.com/reactjs))
+ Async data fetching ([JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/))
+ Testing with [Jest ](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

How to use this sample:

+ Clone the project repo
+ Edit the __homepage__ prop in package.json to match your web server's root for this project. You can remove it if used with the built-in server via __npm start__.
+ Run __npm install__ and __npm run build__ in project root directory
